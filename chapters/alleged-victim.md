# Cross-Examining the Alleged Victim

## Goal  
Reveal inconsistencies, memory gaps, or coached testimony in the complainant’s account.

## Key Tactics  
- Soft tone with sharp logic  
- Disarm with courtesy before exposing contradictions  
- Control narrative structure through phrasing

## Sample Pattern – Intoxication Gaps  
- “You admit drinking that night?”
- “You don’t remember portions of the evening?”
- “But you’re certain about events that happened during those ‘blackout’ periods?”

## Tactical Considerations  
Juries look for honesty. You’re not there to humiliate — you’re there to uncover doubt. Aim to show what *can’t* be remembered clearly should not be treated as fact.
