# Cross-Examining the Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner

## Goal  
Undermine credibility and expose the limits of medical interpretation in forensic exams.

## Key Tactics  
- Translate jargon for jurors  
- Emphasize findings that are “non-specific” or “inconclusive”  
- Show bias through leading language or one-sided conclusions

## Sample Pattern – Injury Descriptions  
- “You used the phrase ‘consistent with assault.’ That’s not definitive, correct?”
- “There are many non-assault explanations for that type of bruising?”
- “You didn't personally witness any part of the alleged event?”

## Tactical Considerations  
Medical language can intimidate jurors. The Trial Warrior brings it down to earth and reveals the gaps between inference and proof.
