# Dealing with Difficult Witnesses

## Goal  
Regain control of the courtroom and dismantle evasive, hostile, or combative witnesses.

## Key Tactics  
- Use short, declarative leading questions  
- Isolate and repeat inconsistencies  
- Corner the witness with yes/no logic chains

## Sample Pattern – Evasive Answers  
- “You were at the party, correct?”
- “You left with the complainant?”
- “You just said ‘I don’t remember’ — is that your answer?”
- “So you’re unsure, but still claim that what happened next was non-consensual?”

## Tactical Considerations  
Jurors respond poorly to slippery witnesses. Trial warriors use rhythm, repetition, and calm pressure to draw attention to the games being played on the stand.
