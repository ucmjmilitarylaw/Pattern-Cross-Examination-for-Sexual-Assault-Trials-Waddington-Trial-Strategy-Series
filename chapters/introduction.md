# Introduction

## Goal  
Introduce the purpose of the book as a trial-tested resource for dismantling sexual assault allegations using pattern-based cross-examination.

## Key Tactics  
- Discredit witness credibility through precision questioning  
- Create reasonable doubt without appearing aggressive  
- Equip defense attorneys with courtroom-ready strategies

## Tactical Considerations  
Cross-examination in sexual assault cases must walk the line between firmness and fairness. This guide provides frameworks that allow attorneys to surgically dismantle testimony while preserving jury trust.

## Sample Pattern – Coaching & Consistency  
- “You spoke to the prosecutor several times before today?”
- “They explained what kinds of things you'd be asked?”
- “You were told to ‘just tell your story,’ correct?”
- “And your story today is almost identical to your written statement?”
